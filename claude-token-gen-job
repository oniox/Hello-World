To ensure proper dependency resolution when multiple jobs need a secret fetched by `use-token`, you need to carefully structure your pipeline stages and job dependencies. Here's how to set it up:

### Pipeline Structure with Proper Dependencies

```yaml
stages:
  - prepare      # Stage for fetching secrets from child project
  - process      # Stage for the initial job using the secret
  - deploy       # Stage for subsequent jobs needing the secret

# Include child project that provides the secret token
include:
  - project: 'your-group/child-project'
    ref: main
    file: '.gitlab-ci.yml'

# Job that initially fetches and uses the token
use-token:
  stage: process
  needs:
    - project: 'your-group/child-project'
      job: export-token
      artifacts: true
  script:
    # The token is available as $EXPORTED_SECRET_TOKEN from dotenv artifact
    - curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXPORTED_SECRET_TOKEN" https://your-api.com/endpoint
    # Store the token for downstream jobs (optional if using dotenv artifacts)
    - echo "SECRET_TOKEN=$EXPORTED_SECRET_TOKEN" >> build.env
  artifacts:
    reports:
      dotenv: build.env
    expire_in: 30 minutes

# Another job that needs the same secret
abc-job:
  stage: deploy
  # Option 1: Direct dependency on both jobs
  needs:
    - job: use-token
    - project: 'your-group/child-project'
      job: export-token
      artifacts: true
  script:
    # The token is available through either source
    - curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $EXPORTED_SECRET_TOKEN" https://another-api.com/endpoint
```

### Alternative Approach: Create a Dedicated Secret-Fetching Job

For better organization, you can split the secret fetching into its own dedicated job:

```yaml
stages:
  - prepare
  - process
  - deploy

# Job solely responsible for fetching the secret
fetch-secret:
  stage: prepare
  needs:
    - project: 'your-group/child-project'
      job: export-token
      artifacts: true
  script:
    # Just pass through the secret from child project
    - echo "SECRET_TOKEN=$EXPORTED_SECRET_TOKEN" > secrets.env
  artifacts:
    reports:
      dotenv: secrets.env
    expire_in: 30 minutes

# Both jobs depend on the fetch-secret job
use-token:
  stage: process
  needs:
    - job: fetch-secret
  script:
    - curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET_TOKEN" https://your-api.com/endpoint

abc-job:
  stage: deploy
  needs:
    - job: fetch-secret
  script:
    - curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET_TOKEN" https://another-api.com/endpoint
```

### Using DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) Keywords

For more complex dependency chains, you can leverage GitLab's DAG keywords:

```yaml
stages:
  - prepare
  - process
  - deploy

fetch-secret:
  stage: prepare
  needs:
    - project: 'your-group/child-project'
      job: export-token
      artifacts: true
  script:
    - echo "SECRET_TOKEN=$EXPORTED_SECRET_TOKEN" > secrets.env
  artifacts:
    reports:
      dotenv: secrets.env
    expire_in: 30 minutes

use-token:
  stage: process
  needs:
    - job: fetch-secret
  script:
    - curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET_TOKEN" https://your-api.com/endpoint

abc-job:
  stage: deploy
  # Use both explicit dependencies and DAG keyword
  needs:
    - job: fetch-secret  # For the secret
    - job: use-token     # To run after use-token completes
  script:
    - curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SECRET_TOKEN" https://another-api.com/endpoint
```

### Best Practices

1. **Explicit over implicit**: Always specify dependencies with `needs:` rather than relying solely on pipeline stages
2. **Minimize secret exposure**: Pass secrets only to jobs that actually need them
3. **Short artifact lifetimes**: Use the shortest practical `expire_in` value for security
4. **Consider parallel vs. serial execution**: With the above approaches, jobs can run in parallel if they're in the same stage, or sequentially based on the `needs:` directive

This approach ensures that both `use-token` and `abc-job` have access to the secret while maintaining proper execution order based on your pipeline's needs.
