 Certainly! I'll create a Java code example that uses Spring JDBCTemplate to execute concurrent queries using 10 threads. This implementation will use a thread pool to manage the concurrent execution of database queries.



```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

@Service
public class ConcurrentQueryService {

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate;

    public List<String> executeConcurrentQueries() {
        int numberOfThreads = 10;
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(numberOfThreads);
        List<Future<String>> futures = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++) {
            final int threadNumber = i;
            futures.add(executorService.submit(() -> executeQuery(threadNumber)));
        }

        List<String> results = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Future<String> future : futures) {
            try {
                results.add(future.get());
            } catch (Exception e) {
                results.add("Error: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }

        executorService.shutdown();
        return results;
    }

    private String executeQuery(int threadNumber) {
        String query = "SELECT * FROM some_table WHERE id = ?";
        return jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(query, new Object[]{threadNumber}, (rs, rowNum) -> 
            "Thread " + threadNumber + ": " + rs.getString("column_name"));
    }
}
```

This Java code demonstrates how to use Spring JDBCTemplate to execute concurrent queries using 10 threads. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

1. We create a `ConcurrentQueryService` class annotated with `@Service` to make it a Spring-managed bean.

2. The `JdbcTemplate` is autowired into the service.

3. The `executeConcurrentQueries()` method is the main entry point:
   - It creates a fixed thread pool with 10 threads using `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()`.
   - It submits 10 tasks to the executor service, each calling the `executeQuery()` method.
   - The results are collected from the futures and returned as a list of strings.

4. The `executeQuery()` method demonstrates a simple query execution:
   - It uses a parameterized query to select data from a table.
   - The thread number is used as a parameter in the query.
   - The result is mapped to a string containing the thread number and a column value.

To use this service, you would need to:

1. Ensure you have the necessary Spring and database dependencies in your project.
2. Configure your database connection in the Spring application context.
3. Autowire and call the `ConcurrentQueryService` from another component or controller.

Note that this is a simplified example. In a real-world scenario, you might want to:

- Add error handling and logging.
- Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently.
- Consider using Spring's `@Async` annotation for simpler asynchronous execution.
- Adjust the query and result mapping to fit your specific use case.

Would you like me to explain any part of this code in more detail?
