Requirement
I need to update my current gitlab ci/cd pipeline to add an optional deploy stage. This stage will deploy artifact (java jar)  as built and uploaded to Nexus repo to a Kubernetes based Veverica flink job. Multiple jobs can be deployed per environment. The job names are of the format  job-a-env, job-b-env. Assume there are at least 3 such jobs per environment. Consider that the id of a job is dynamic hence needs to be fetched via API for each execution (the look up key will be the job name e.g job-a-env) 

Implementation 
The flink job will be suspended using veverica api, then latest artifact created as part of the current pipeline deployed then job started / restored using the veverica api. Consider using extends keyword in gitlab yaml instead of the generic yaml notation. 

How do I go about implementing this ?
